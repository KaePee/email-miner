# A simple tool to mine Temporal mail addresses

This script mines data from www.10minutemail.com by default.
You can modify the code to mine any form of data as long as you feed it the api and the form of response you want.

**For educational purposes only!**

## Issues

You can add pandas or numpy to export mined emails to a csv or txt file.
No try and exception cases or errors to catch. Sorry...
This is just 'bare-code'. Nothing fancy here. It works extremely well if you know what you are using it for.
Feel free to branch and work on better solutions. Thank you
